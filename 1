1. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed
in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

listnumber=[]
for i in range(2000,3200):
    if (i%7 == 0)and (i%5 != 0):
        listnumber.append(str(i))
print(",".join(listnumber))

2. Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.

fname=input("first name: ")
lname=input("last name: ")
print('Hello '+lname+" " +fname)

3. Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r 3
   
import math
## diameter of sphere as 12 cm
d=12
## calculate radius using diameter
r=d/2
#volumn constant for volumn 
v=4/3*math.pi*r**3
print("volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm is : ",v)
